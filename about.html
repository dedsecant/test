       <p class="px-96 py-5 w-fit">Before acquisition by ONGC in March 2003, MRPL, was a joint venture Oil Refinery promoted by M/s Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), a public sector company and M/s Indian Rayon and industries limited(IRIL) (AV Birla Group). MRPL was set up in 1988 with the initial processing capacity of 3.69 MMTPA that was later expanded to the present capacity of 15.0 MMTPA. The Refinery was conceived to maximise distillates, with capability to process light to heavy and sour to sweet Crudes with 24 to 46 API gravity. On 28th March 2003, ONGC acquired the total shareholding of A.V. Birla Group and further infused equity capital of Rs.600 crores thus making MRPL a majority held subsidiary of ONGC.</p>

            <p class="px-24 w-11/12 pb-16">In a dynamic world where energy demands are ever-increasing and environmental concerns loom large, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) has emerged as a versatile and eco-friendly solution. LPG, a byproduct of natural gas processing and crude oil refining, has revolutionized the energy landscape by offering a clean-burning alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Its composition mainly comprises propane and butane, making it an efficient and low-emission energy source.
                <br><br>
                LPG's significance lies not only in its diverse applications – from household cooking and heating to industrial processes and transportation – but also in its environmental benefits. When compared to conventional fuels like coal and oil, LPG combustion releases fewer harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases, contributing to improved air quality and reduced carbon footprint. Furthermore, its portability, ease of storage, and efficient combustion make LPG a reliable energy choice for both developed and developing economies. As we navigate the path towards a sustainable future, LPG stands as a beacon of hope, illuminating the way toward cleaner energy solutions and a greener planet.</p>
